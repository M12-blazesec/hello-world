# hello-world
This is my hello world repository, im getting a feel for github, cause im a newbie.

I am M-12 of the Blaze-Sec Programming COllective, and I am just now making my first github account and repository, as I finally have a genuine need for one. If you are interested, you can add whatever the hell you want to it, or you can check out some of my other repositories. Anyways, I really don't care. Thanks for reading this far.
